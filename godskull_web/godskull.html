<pre>LOOT GENERATOR
NOTES:
Loot the Body is for exactly what it sounds like as well as pickpocketing people and looting furniture. It has a small chance of giving a Magic Item but will never yield very large amounts of gold.
Treasure Chest is for exactly what it sounds like. It will always yield 1 Loot the Body result, 1 large amount of gold, and 1 magic item. I might roll at the table to decided if the chest contains all 3 results or not.
Magic Items is for exactly what it sounds like and it doesn't roll on any other table, most of its results are from Grave right now.
Sources: Grave, Maze Rats, Die Trying, DonJon's pickpocket loot generator, AD&D Dungeon Master's Guide, probably another place.
