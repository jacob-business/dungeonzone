GOBLIN GENERATOR / NPC generator

Short-name/nickname = random sounds (optionally from each word of your real name, very short name)
Last name/full name = Get GÃ¼d Roll + class + weapon or weapon + class depending on what sounds best.

So for example, Urmock (Greasy Crooked Sword) is a random name (urmock) and Greasy + Thief Class = Crooked + Weapon = Sword
